Developers can thus easily test and benchmark their applications on classical computing hardware and then deploy it to neuromorphic hardware. Furthermore, Lava takes advantage of distributed, heterogeneous hardware such as Loihi as it can run some _Processes_ on neuromorphic cores and in parallel others on embedded conventional CPUs and GPUs.\n","\n","While Lava provides a growing [library of Processes](https://github.com/lava-nc/lava/tree/main/src/lava/proc \"Lava's process library\"), you can easily write your own processes that suit your needs."],"id":"gsyjFVIlwMNe"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BTPmMnBdwMNf"},"source":["## How to build a _Process_?\n","\n","#### Overall architecture\n","\n","All _Processes_ in Lava share a universal architecture as they inherit from the same _AbstractProcess_ class.
